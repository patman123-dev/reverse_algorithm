# Reverse Audio Algorithm ðŸŽ§

A C++ implementation of an in-place reverse algorithm, originally designed for processing audio data such as MP3 frames. This project forms the foundation of a full mobile app that plays audio files in reverse.

---

## ðŸ”§ What It Does

- Reverses an array of audio data (or any generic array) in-place.
- Forms the core logic for reversing audio playback.
- Optimized for performance and memory usage.
- Meant to integrate with a GUI front end (Java/Android Studio via JNI).

## ðŸ§  Algorithm Overview

The core algorithm uses a simple in-place swap pattern:

```cpp
void reverseArray(int arr[], int size) {
    int start = 0, end = size - 1;
    while (start < end) {
        swap(arr[start], arr[end]);
        start++;
        end--;
    }
}
